Hong Kong billionaireHenry Cheng’s Chow Tai Fook Enterprises and tycoon David Chiu’s Far East Consortium had rescued cash-strappedStar Entertainment Groupfrom the brink of collapse after agreeing to buy the Australian casino operator’s stake in a Brisbane property.
The Hong Kong partners will pay A$53 million ($33.4 million) for Star’s 50% stake in the Brisbane integrated casino complex, Hong Kong-listed Far East said in astatementlate Friday. Star will immediately receive A$35 million, injecting much needed cash to the embattled company, which counts Australian billionaire Bruce Mathieson among its shareholders.
As part of the transaction, Star will acquire the stakes of its Hong Kong partners in their Gold Coast Project, consisting of two hotel towers, with Chow Tai Fook and Far East will retain certain rights to participate in the next tower to be built on the site, according to the statement.
Star has been seeking fresh capital amid slumping gaming revenues. Last month, the company said it is exploring various options to increase its liquidity, including the sale of its stake in the Brisbane integrated casino resort complex, as it has limited capacity to raise A$150 million in subordinated debt. This funding is a crucial requirement for unlocking an additional A$100 million loan.
The troubles of Star started in 2021 after the Sydney Morning Herald reported that the company allowed money laundering and organized crimes in its casinos for years. The following year, regulators ruled that the company was unsuitable to operate its casinos in Sydney and Queensland, placing them under government supervision. Since then, almost A$4 billion in Star’s market capitalization has been wiped out.
Chow Tai Fook—the private investment company of the Cheng family—is participating in the Star deal even as patriarch Henry Cheng isgrappling with unprecedented losses and burgeoning debtsat their flagship company, New World Development. That’s blown a hole through Cheng’s fortune, which was down $2.6 billion—the biggest drop in dollar terms than anyone when Forbes published the list of Hong Kong’s 50 richest last month—to $19.5 billion, though he remains the third richest.

References to the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan during World War II have been flagged for removal in Pentagon documents as the Department of Defense purges references related to diversity, equity and inclusion—in this case, presumably because of the word “gay.”

Tens of thousands of photos and online posts across the Department of Defense have been flagged for deletion as part of a purge targeting DEI-related materials, theAssociated Pressreported, following President Donald Trump’s executive order eliminating DEI programs across the federal government.
Among the items flagged for deletion is the World War IIEnola Gayaircraft, which bears the name of Enola Gay Tibbets, the mother of military pilot Paul Tibbets.
The AP, citing a military database confirmed by U.S. officials, also reported other photos and posts containing the word “gay” were flagged for deletion, including references to people who have the last name “Gay.”
The marks for deletion target women and people of color the most, the AP reported, including references to the country’s first Black military pilots and mentions of commemorative months, including Women’s History Month.
The purge follows Secretary of DefensePete Hegseth’sdirective last week for the Pentagon to “remove all DoD news and feature articles, photos, and videos that promote Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI),” citing Trump’s executive order.
Pentagon spokesperson John Ullyot told the AP the department is “pleased by the rapid compliance across the Department with the directive removing DEI content,” clarifying if “content is removed that is out of the clearly outlined scope of the directive, we instruct components accordingly.” (Forbes reached out to the Department of Defense for further comment).
TheEnola Gayaircraft was the first military aircraft to drop an atomic bomb during war. The aircraft, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress, dropped the bomb code-named “Little Boy” on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945. Five years ago, the Department of Defense published a 75th-anniversarytributeto the aircraft, crediting it with “bringing an end to a long and devastating World War II” while acknowledging it as one of the most famous military aircrafts in history.
Following Trump’s day-oneexecutive ordertargeting DEI programs across the federal government, agencies have eliminated positions and altered language to remove references to “diversity”—but the order has sowed some confusion over how to comply. In a purge of all references to diversity, equity and inclusion from an Internal Revenue Service manual, the IRS erroneously deleted sentences completely unrelated to diversity. One sentence that was axed included a reference to the “inclusion” of a taxpayer identification number on a form, while another mentioned the “inequity” of holding on to a taxpayer’s money, theWall Street Journalreported. The Defense Intelligence Agency ordered a pause oncommemorative months, including Black History Month, though the White House issued a proclamation in February recognizing the month and urging public officials to “observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.” Trump’s federal funding freeze, which includedfundingfor programs promoting “DEI” or “woke gender ideology,” also spreadconfusionabout how to comply and what constitutes promoting DEI.
Trump targeted DEI in the Defense Department in several executive orders. In oneorder, issued on Jan. 27, Trump ordered the department to eliminate DEI offices, engage in color-blind hiring and promotions and cease promoting “gender ideology.” In anotherorderissued the same day, Trump effectively banned transgender people from serving in the military. ThePentagon saidlast week transgender troops currently serving will be removed from their posts. Hegseth has opposed DEI in the Defense Department, tellingFox Newsin January it is “dead.”

Title: Stocks Suffer Worst Week In 6 Months—Despite Friday Bounce
Date: No Publication Date
Content:
A Friday rally was not enough to reverse a brutal start to March for U.S. stocks, as investors digested a barrage ofeconomicdataand policies from President Donald Trump, particularly theuncertaintyof his extensive tariffs on the country’stopthree trade partners.
It's a red March thus far in the stock market.
The most widely followed American stock index, the S&P 500 (down 3.1% since last Friday) registered its worst weekly losses since the week ending Sept. 6, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (down 2.4%) suffered its worst loss since February.
That came even as the Dow rose 0.5%, or 220 points, and the S&P gained 0.6% in Friday trading as February’sjobs reportcame in just shy of economist forecasts.The S&P closed at its lowest end-of-week level since the week ending Nov. 1, ahead of the election.
The S&P closed at its lowest end-of-week level since the week ending Nov. 1, ahead of the election.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the Russell 2000, which tracks smaller companies with a median market capitalization of about $1 billion, suffered even bigger percentage losses this week, as the Nasdaq fell 3.5% to its lowest end-of-week price since early October and the Russell sank 3.9% to its lowest level since June.
Driving the losses were flipflops from Trump on tariffs, as his 25% levies on Canadian and Mexican goods and 10% additional duty on Chinese imports went into effect Tuesday,beforedelaying most of the Canadian and Mexican tariffs until April on Thursday, and thenteasingnew tariffs on some Canadian goods Friday.
“I’m not even looking at the market,” TrumpsaidThursday, before adding there will be “a little short-term interruption.”
More than $3 trillion. That’s how much market value has been wiped out from the S&P from its Feb. 19 all-time high, according to FactSet data, as the index fell 6%.
In terms of market value lost, Elon Musk’s car company Tesla and artificial intelligence chip designer Nvidia are the two biggest losers dating back to Feb. 19, as Nvidia lost $712 billion in market cap and Tesla $322 billion in that timeframe. In addition to Nvidia and Tesla, a slew of big-name companies suffered 8% or greater stock selloffs this week, including American Express, Bank of America, Boeing, Citigroup, Costco, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Netflix and Wells Fargo.
Beyond the likely negative impact on corporate earnings, at least in the short term, of tariffs, the constantly shifting tariff implementation dates and exceptions have led to heightened uncertainty, something investors largelydespise.“It seems as if there have been very few times in markets where one has to interpret so much disparate, and at times conflicting, data relative to the economy and influences on it,” Rick Rieder, the head of BlackRock’s global allocation investment team, wrote to clients Friday. Stocks initially soared after Trump’s November win, as the Dow tacked on about 3,000 points in the three weeks after the election, gains spurred by prevailing hopes of corporate tax cuts and more lax regulations, before sentiment soured as Trump enacted his economic agenda. Trump’s “policies appear to be tilting towards a less business-friendly stance,” remarked JPMorgan Chase economists Bruce Kasman and Joseph Lupton in a Friday note. The S&P is down about 4% dating back to Trump’s January inauguration.
