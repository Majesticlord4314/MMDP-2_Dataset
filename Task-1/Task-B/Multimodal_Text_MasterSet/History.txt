Many people render the term’s second word in its plural form. However, since the word “saving” acts as part of an adjective rather than a verb, the singular is grammatically correct.
By the time he was a 78-year-old American envoy in Paris in 1784, the man who espoused the virtues of “early to bed and early to rise” was not practicing what he preached. After being unpleasantly stirred from sleep at 6 a.m. by the summer sun, the founding father penned a satirical essay in which he calculated that Parisians, simply by waking up at dawn, could save the modern-day equivalent of $200 million through “the economy of using sunshine instead of candles.” As a result of this essay,Franklinis often erroneously given the honor of “inventing” daylight saving time, but he only proposed a change in sleep schedules—not the time itself.
While on an early-morning horseback ride around the desolate outskirts of London in 1905, Willett had an epiphany that the United Kingdom should move its clocks forward by 80 minutes between April and October so that more people could enjoy the plentiful sunlight. The Englishman published the 1907 brochure “The Waste of Daylight” and spent much of his personal fortune evangelizing with missionary zeal for the adoption of “summer time.” Year after year, however, the British Parliament stymied the measure, and Willett died in 1915 at age 58 without ever seeing his idea come to fruition.
It tookWorld War Ifor Willett’s dream to come true, but on April 30, 1916, Germany embraced daylight saving time to conserve electricity. (He may have been horrified to learn that Britain’s wartime enemy followed his recommendations before his homeland.) Weeks later, the United Kingdom followed suit and introduced “summertime.”
America The Story of Us is an epic 12-hour television event that tells the extraordinary story of how America was invented.
Contrary to popular belief, American farmers did not lobby for daylight saving to have more time to work in the fields; in fact, the agriculture industry was deeply opposed to the time switch when it was first implemented on March 31, 1918, as a wartime measure. The sun, not the clock, dictated farmers’ schedules, so daylight saving was very disruptive. Farmers had to wait an extra hour for dew to evaporate to harvest hay, hired hands worked less since they still left at the same time for dinner and cows weren’t ready to be milked an hour earlier to meet shipping schedules. Agrarian interests led the fight for the 1919 repeal of national daylight saving time, which passed after Congress voted to override President Woodrow Wilson’s veto. Rather than rural interests, it has been urban entities such as retail outlets and recreational businesses that have championed daylight saving over the decades.
After the national repeal in 1919, some states and cities, includingNew York CityandChicago, continued to shift their clocks. National daylight saving time returned duringWorld War II, but after its repeal three weeks after the war’s end the confusing hodgepodge resumed. States and localities could start and end daylight saving whenever they pleased, a system thatTimemagazine (an aptly named source) described in 1963 as “a chaos of clocks.”
In 1965 there were 23 different pairs of start and end dates in Iowa alone, and St. Paul, Minnesota, even began daylight saving two weeks before its twin city, Minneapolis. Passengers on a 35-mile bus ride from Steubenville, Ohio, to Moundsville, West Virginia, passed through seven time changes. Order finally came in 1966 with the enactment of theUniform Time Act, which standardized daylight saving time from the last Sunday in April to the last Sunday in October, although states had the option of remaining on standard time year-round.
HawaiiandArizona—with the exception of the state’s Navajo Nation—do not observe daylight saving time, and the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands also remain on standard time year-round. Some Amish communities also choose not to participate in daylight saving time. (Around the world, only about one-quarter of the world’s population, in approximately 70 countries, observe daylight saving. Since their daylight hours don’t vary much from season to season, countries closer to the equator have little need to deviate from standard time.)
Dating back to Willett, daylight-saving advocates have touted energy conservation as an economic benefit. A U.S. Department of Transportation study in the 1970s concluded that total electricity savings associated with daylight saving time amounted to about 1 percent in the spring and fall months. As air conditioning has become more widespread, however, more recent studies have found that cost savings on lighting are more than offset by greater cooling expenses. University of California Santa Barbara economists calculated that Indiana’s move to statewide daylight saving time in 2006 led to a 1-percent rise in residential electricity use through additional demand for air conditioning on summer evenings and heating in early spring and late fall mornings. Some also argue that increased recreational activity during daylight saving results in greater gasoline consumption.

Title: When Harriet Tubman Led a Brazen Civil War Raid

Updated:August 29, 2023|Original:November 1, 2019
They called her “Moses” for leading enslaved people in the South to freedom up North. ButHarriet Tubmanfought the institution of slavery well beyond her role as a conductor for theUnderground Railroad. As a soldier and spy for the Union Army during theCivil War, Tubman became the first woman to lead an armed military operation in the United States in what is known as theCombahee Ferry Raid.
By January 1, 1863, when theEmancipation Proclamationwent into effect, Tubman had been in South Carolina as a volunteer for the Union Army. With her family behind in Auburn, New York, and having established herself as a prominent abolitionist in Boston circles, Tubman, at the request of Massachusetts Governor John Andrew, had gone to Hilton Head, South Carolina, which had fallen to the Union Army early in the war.
For months, Tubman worked as a laundress, opening a wash house, and serving as a nurse, until she was given orders to form a spy ring. Tubman had proven herself invaluable at gathering clandestine information, forming allies and avoiding capture, as she led the Underground Railroad. In her new role, Tubman assumed leadership of a secret military mission in South Carolina’s low country.
“First and foremost, her priorities would be to defeat and destroy the system of slavery and in doing so, to definitely defeat the Confederacy,” saidBrandi Brimmer, a history professor at Spelman College and slavery historian.
Tubman partnered with Colonel James Montgomery, an abolitionist who commanded the Second South Carolina Volunteers, a Black regiment. Together, the two planned a raid along the Combahee River, to rescue enslaved people, recruit freed men into the Union Army and obliterate some of the wealthiest rice plantations in the region.
Montgomery had around 300 men, including 50 from a Rhode Island Regiment and Tubman rounded up eight scouts, who helped her map the area and send word to enslaved people when the raid would take place.
“She was fearless and she was courageous,” said Kate Clifford Larson, historian and author ofBound for the Promised Land: Harriet Tubman, Portrait of an American Hero. “She had a sensibility. She could get Black people to trust her and the Union officers knew that they were not trusted by the local people.”
Born into slavery, Harriet Tubman escaped to freedom in the North in 1849 and then risked her life to lead other enslaved people to freedom.
From elaborate disguises to communicating in code to fighting back, enslaved people found multiple paths to freedom.
Find out more about Rose O'Neal Greenhow and three other female informants who played a significant role in America’s bloodiest conflict.
The night of June 1, 1863, Tubman and Montgomery, on a federal ship theJohn Adams,led two other gunboats, theSentinelandHarriet A. Weed, out of the St. Helena Sound towards the Combahee River. En route, theSentinelran aground, causing troops from that ship to transfer to the other two boats.
As explained in Catherine Clinton’s book,Harriet Tubman: The Road to Freedom, Tubman, who was illiterate, couldn’t write down any intelligence she gathered. Instead, she committed everything to memory, guiding the ships towards strategic points near the shore where fleeing slaves were waiting and Confederate property could be destroyed, all while leading the steamers away from known torpedoes.
“They needed to take gunboats up the river,” said Clinton. “They could have been blown up if they hadn’t had her intelligence.”
Around 2:30 a.m. on June 2, theJohn Adamsand theHarriet A. Weedsplit up along the river to conduct different raids. Tubman led 150 men on theJohn Adamstoward the fugitives. Tubman, later commenting on the raid, said once the signal was given, she saw slaves running everywhere, with women carrying babies, crying children, squealing pigs, chickens and pots of rice. Rebels tried chasing down the slaves, firing their guns on them. One girl was reportedly killed.
As the escapees ran to the shore, Black troops in rowboats transported them to the ships, but chaos ensued in the process. Tubman, who didn’t speak the region’s Gullah dialect, reportedly went on deck and sang a popular song from the abolitionist movement that calmed the group down.
More than 700 escaped slavery and made it onto the gunboats. Troops also disembarked near Field’s Point, torching plantations, fields, mills, warehouses and mansions, causing a humiliating defeat for the Confederacy, including the loss of a pontoon bridge shot to pieces by the gunboats.
The ships docked in Beaufort, South Carolina, where a reporter from theWisconsin State Journalheard what had happened on the Combahee River. He wrote a story without a byline about the “She-Moses” but never mentioned Tubman’s name. He wrote that Montgomery’s “gallant band of 300 soldiers under the guidance of a Black woman, dashed into the enemies’ country, struck a bold and effective blow, destroying millions of dollars worth of commissary store, cotton and lordly dwellings, and striking terror to the heart of the rebeldom brought off bear 800 slaves and thousands of dollars worth of property, without losing a man or receiving a scratch.”
But Tubman’s anonymity came to an end in July 1863 when Franklin Sanborn, the editor of Boston’sCommonwealthnewspaper, picked up the story and named Harriet Tubman, a friend of his, as the heroine.
Despite the mission’s success, including the recruitment of at least 100 freedmen into the Union Army, Tubman was not compensated for her efforts on the Combahee Ferry Raid. She had petitioned the government several times to be paid for her duties as a soldier. “She was denied because she was a woman,” says Larson.
“By the time we get to the Emancipation Proclamation, we have Lincoln setting out concrete spaces for Black men and their recognition in military service,” said Brimmer. “But there's not really a vision for the work of women who function in the military bearing arms, particularly Black women.”
Tubman would eventually get a pension, but only as the widow of a Black Union soldier she married after the war, not for her courageous service as a soldier.

Title: Why Do We Have Daylight Saving Time?
Date: No Publication Date

Updated:August 24, 2023|Original:March 6, 2014
Many think that daylight saving time was conceived to give farmers an extra hour of sunlight to till their fields, but this is a common misconception. In fact, farmers have long been opposed to springing forward and falling back, since it throws off their usual harvesting schedule.
The real reasons for daylight saving are based on energy conservation and a desire to match daylight hours to the times when most people are awake. The idea dates back to 1895 when entomologist George Vernon Hudson unsuccessfully proposed an annual two-hour time shift to the Royal Society of New Zealand.
Ten years later, the British construction magnate William Willett picked up where Hudson left off when he argued that the United Kingdom should adjust their clocks by 80 minutes each spring and fall to give people more time to enjoy daytime recreation. Willett was a tireless advocate of what he called “Summer Time,” but his idea never made it through Parliament.
The first real experiments with daylight saving time began duringWorld War I.On April 30, 1916, Germany and Austria implemented a one-hour clock shift to conserve electricity needed for the war effort. The United Kingdom and several other European nations adopted daylight saving shortly after that, and the United States followed suit in 1918. (While Germany and Austria were the first countries to implement daylight savings, the first towns toimplement a seasonal time shift werePort Arthur and Fort William, Canadain 1908.)
Most Americans only saw the time adjustment as a wartime act, and it was later repealed in 1919. Standard time ruled until 1942, when PresidentFranklin D. Rooseveltre-instituted daylight saving duringWorld War II. This time, more states continued using daylight saving after the conflict ended, but for decades there was little consistency with regard to its schedule. Finally, in 1966, Congress passed the Uniform Time Act, which standardized daylight saving across the country and established its start and end times in April and October (later changed to March and November in 2007).
Today, daylight saving time is used in dozens of countries across the globe, but it remains a controversial practice. Most studies show that its energy savings are only negligible, and some have even found that costs are higher since people in hot climates are more apt to use air conditioners in the daytime. Meanwhile,HawaiiandArizonahave opted out of daylight saving all together and remain on standard time year-round.

Title: Guidance: Links and feeds
Date: No Publication Date
Content:
This guidance note relates to the following Editorial Guidelines:
Part 2: Inbound feeds and embeds
This Guidance Note is designed to help you select and manage suitable external links to other sites from BBC Online. It is also designed to help you select and manage suitable inbound feeds and other online sources of third-party content for publication on BBC Online.
For advice on distribution, including syndication, see Editorial Guidelines Section 16 External Relationships and Financing: Distribution.
SeeEditorial Guidelines Section 16 External Relationships and Financing: Distribution  16.3.14 – 16.3.16
The BBC’s global reputation is based on its editorial integrity and independence.  Our audiences need to be confident that our decisions are influenced neither by political or commercial pressures, nor by any personal interests. We must not undermine these values by any actions which could bring the BBC into disrepute.
The Editorial Guidelines state that:
Links to external sites
Whenever producers are creating content on a BBC site, they should actively consider which external websites it may be editorially justifiable to link to.
Editorial justification for linking to external sites
Producers may wish to offer links to external sites for a number of reasons, including:
A link must never be included on the public service site or within the editorial content of a commercial site in return for cash, services or any other consideration in kind.
All links on the BBC Public Service site or on the editorial pages of a BBC Commercial site must be editorially justifiable and suitable for the intended audience – particularly children.
Links are not acceptable as a form of credit.
Producers must check the contents of the site which is signposted before adding a link to a BBC page, although responsibility for including the link lies with the relevant editor.
Where this is practical, we should consider ways to make it easy for users who find broken, stale or inappropriate external BBC links to report these to us so that we can check, update, replace or remove them.
Where we publish a list of links we should add the standard disclaimer to the effect that "the BBC is not responsible for the contents of any other sites listed". If the links are to controversial or challenging material, it  may be appropriate to add a specific disclaimer and more information, closer to the links,  even when there are only one or two links on a page. For “in story” links to such material, for example to very sensitive content such as a gruelling account of torture, it may be helpful to alert the user to this, in context, as part of telling the story.
Links to sites which do not share BBC editorial values
Context is important in deciding whether a link is appropriate and it is often useful to explain why we are offering the link. In some cases we may offer a link to a site which does not share our editorial values, but which offers a useful insight. For example we might link from a current affairs page to the site of a government-run national news agency so that the user can see the precise words used in a government statement.
Controversial content
We must be duly impartial.  BBC sites which cover a controversial or public policy matter may offer links to external sites which, taken together, represent a reasonable range of views about the subject. We should ensure that when we link to third party sites that we take into account any concerns about potential breaches of the law, for example, defamation or incitement to racial hatred.
Where content is likely to cause serious offence to some users and yet there is a strong editorial justification for covering the story, it may be editorially justifiable for the BBC to link to the relevant site rather than to host the content ourselves.
Links to charity sites have to be based on sensible editorial criteria. If one charity is in the news, it may be appropriate to establish a link to the site of that charity. But we must take care not to promote one charity above another. If we are giving advice or general information about the subject and wish to refer to a charity and there is a range of charities working in the field, we should normally link to the other significant charities working in the field as well. This guidance applies to online links offered by BBC Action Lines.
(SeeEditorial Guidelines Section 14 : Independence from External Interests: BBC Support Services 14.3.26)
We should also consider where on the charity website we link to – for example it may be appropriate to link to useful sources of information, but not to campaigning or fundraising pages.
For programme support pages, an external link should be justified by the relevance and value of the material to the programme's viewers and listeners. If we give a link to an outside advice agency from a support page, we should give links to a reasonable range of other relevant agencies as well.
Where a consumer programme reviews a product or service, we should only offer links to the sites of the manufacturers, suppliers or retailers of any goods or services mentioned where strictly editorially justifiable.
There must be no undue prominence of products, services or trade marks in our content.
(SeeEditorial Guidelines Section 14 : Independence from External Interests: Product Prominence 14.3.1)
Public Services must not endorse or promote any other organisation, or its products, services or trademarks, so great care must be taken when linking to any site in order not to give the impression that the BBC is doing so.
BBC Public Service sites should not normally link direct to pages whose main purpose is transactional e.g. selling merchandise, downloads or tickets.
See exceptions below for links to buy BBC-related programme content and links to buy tickets for BBC Events. There are some occasions where we may also wish to link directly to a donations page for a BBC charitable appeal.
(SeeEditorial Guidelines Section 16 External Relationships and Financing: Charities 16.3.43)
If in any doubt, refer to Editorial Policy.
Links from BBC Public Services to the BBC’s Commercial sites
BBC programmes and sites regularly cover music concerts and tours. Linking policy to sites where users can buy tickets will depend on the nature of the event.
If it is a BBC mounted or run event (on the Public Services to contribute to the BBC’s Mission and Public Purposes), then a direct link to the source of the tickets is likely to be editorially justifiable.
(SeeEditorial Guidelines Section 16 External Relationships and Financing  Ticket Sales 16.3.34)
If it is not a BBC mounted or run event (and where for example a BBC network is simply broadcasting a concert organised by someone else) then a direct link to the relevant band’s site is likely to be editorially justifiable, with one more click from there to the ticket agency’s site.
Pulling third-party content on to BBC Online pages is more editorially sensitive than linking externally. Following an external link takes you away from the BBC site and users have a chance to adjust their expectations in the light of that journey. But as third party content sits with BBC content on BBC branded pages, users are more likely to expect it to have been through a rigorous editorial examination and to comply with BBC editorial standards before being published on our site.
Editorial responsibility
The person who is editorially responsible for the page on which the feed or embed appears will be responsible for the content from that feed or embed. This principle will apply whether it is a bespoke feed to a single page or a general feed to many pages.
We would not normally embed a live feed of video or text unless we had a contractual relationship with the supplier that provides assurances about the content or we could be otherwise confident that the content is appropriate to be shared on our own platforms.
Where we take in content from an external supplier, we should be transparent about it with our users. Attribution should be as close as possible to the content in question.
We should provide a clear and easy route for our users to report a mistake or find offensive or inappropriate content on a feed.
Embedded video, for example of a social networking site video player such as YouTube or Vimeo on a BBC page, may be a useful way to display editorially relevant non-BBC content.
Even though the content is not under our control it appears to the audience that it is part of our online content. We should therefore make it clear that the embedded video is from a third party site and give the audience a direct route to report to the relevant editorial team any inappropriate content, such as advertising, that might appear on that video.

Title: Lupus, lymphoma – or murder? Why Jane Austen's mysterious cause of death has puzzled historians for years
Date: No Publication Date
Content:
In BBC dramaMiss Austen, Jane's sister Cassandra is on a mission to destroy a cache of letters following the 41-year-old Jane's death. But by destroying these documents, which may have contained key medical details about Jane's final illness, Cassandra denied historians vital evidence, causing wild theories about her cause of death to swirl for years. Hilary Mitchell investigates how much we know about the real story…
The medical landscape in the early 19th century was – unsurprisingly – vastly different to today. During the lifetime ofJane Austen, who died in 1817 at the age of 41, diseases were rife and often fatal, and knowledge of human anatomy was scanty.
A visit to the doctor was expensive and there was little effective treatment available beyond alcohol, opium, and bloodletting with leeches. Germs had yet to be identified, antiseptics and antibiotics were unheard of, and surgery was performed without anaesthetic. Most medicine was herbal and came from apothecaries who made remedies and gave general health advice.
Most of the ‘cure-alls’ on sale at the time were entirely without benefit. For example, London’s Old Operating Theatre museum owns adomestic medicine chestfrom that period, which contains a bottle of Steers’s Chemical Opodeldoc, a popular liniment.
An eye-opening 1783 advert for Opodeldoclists the many things it can cure – everything from tendon injuries (“In wounded Tendons it is likewise of the greatest Service, by Preventing the Juice which oozes out of them from fixing) to injured horses that are “strained in the back Sinews… or have their Backs galled”. Not bad for an ointment that was, according to a recipe in 1856 textThe Medical Formulary, just a mixture of soap, alcohol, camphor and ammonia.
Against this backdrop of confusion about the nature of illnesses and how to cure them, it should come as no great shock to discover that Jane Austen’s official cause of death was never clearly documented.
Instead, her family and attending physician – the esteemed Dr Giles King Lyford, a surgeon at the county hospital at Winchester – recorded that she died of a vague illness referred to as "consumption" or "decline." No post-mortem was ever performed.
Jane Austen's letters describe how she was plagued by awful ill health in the final years of her life, which left her bedridden at her home in the village of Chawton, near Alton in Hampshire.
In May 1817 she wrote a letter to her friend Anne Sharp, detailing a recent “attack”, explaining: “My chief [sic] sufferings were from feverish nights, weakness & Languor. This Discharge was on me for above a week, & as our Alton Apothy [Apothecary] did not pretend to be able to cope with it, better advice was called in. Our nearest very good, is at Winchester, where there is a Hospital & capital Surgeons, & one of them attended me, & his applications gradually removed the Evil.”
Jane travelled to Winchester to place herself in the care of Lyford two days later, but she never returned home. She died on 18 July 1817 with her devoted sister, Cassandra, by her side.
Whenever there’s a significant gap in any important historical record, theories – both rational and not-so-rational – will inevitably spring up, and Jane’s death is no different.
One of the most outlandish ideas to be put forward in recent years is that Jane was murdered.
In 2011, crime novelist Lindsay Ashford seized on the fact that traces of arsenic had been found in thePride and Prejudiceauthor’s body, and concluded that she must have been poisoned.
According to the Guardian, while reading Jane’s letters, the crime novelist spotted the following sentence, written shortly before her death: "I am considerably better now and am recovering my looks a little, which have been bad enough, black and white and every wrong colour."
Ashford realised the symptoms could be ascribed to arsenic poisoning, which can cause "raindrop" pigmentation, where patches of skin go brown or black. After discovering that a lock of Jane’s hair had tested positive for the substance, she said: "I don't think murder is out of the question," she said, adding: “In the early 19th century a lot of people were getting away with murder with arsenic as a weapon.”
However, Ashford’s claims were dismissed by Professor Janet Todd, who edited theCambridge edition of the works of Jane Austen, who noted that many 19th century ‘cure-alls’ contained arsenic, including remedies that claimed to treat rheumatism, which Jane could have taken.
Another illness that may have caused Jane’s symptoms is Addison’s Disease, first proposed by English physician and author Zachary Cope in 1964. This rare condition involving adrenal insufficiency, causes fatigue, weakness, weight loss, and white and dark patches on the skin.
This diagnosis has fallen out of favour over the years. One key issue with it is that tubercular Addison’s is often rapidly fatal, yet Jane was ill for about a year before her death in 1817.
A third plausible candidate for Jane’s cause of death is Hodgkin’s disease, a form of lymphoma. Journalist Claire Tomalin took issue with Cope’s diagnosis in her 1997 book Jane Austen: A Life, proposing Hodgkin’s instead, a conclusion also reached by Annette Upfal, professor of British literature at the University of Queensland, in a2005 Medical Humanities article.
In her letters, Jane described experiencing periodic fevers, a hallmark of Hodgkin lymphoma. Hodgkin’s is also a slowly progressive condition, which matches Jane’s year-long decline. Her fevers also seemed to come and go in cycles, a distinctive characteristic of the illness.
An even more recently proposed theory is that Jane may have died of systemic lupus erythematosus. This chronic autoimmune disease affects multiple organs, causing fatigue, joint pain, skin issues, and organ damage – and also causes recurrent fevers – all symptoms that align with descriptions of her illness. The theory was put forward in 2022 by retired surgeon Michael Sanders following a comprehensive review of all of Jane’s surviving letters.
Were more symptoms described in any of the thousands of letters burned by Cassandra? It seems very likely; and just a few additional details could have helped historians to solve this medical conundrum conclusively.
Of the approximately 3,000 letters Jane Austen is thought to have written, only about 160 remain, many heavily edited by Cassandra or others.
However, it’s likely that she only had the best of intentions in doing so – a desire to protect and preserve Jane’s public image. Jane’s characters showcase the author’s stinging wit and ability to come up with incredible takedowns and scathing retorts. Her letters may well have contained critical or unflattering comments about family members or influential people of their time.
It’s also worth noting that Jane was a private individual and may not have wanted her correspondence to be preserved. Nor might Cassandra have foreseen the letters’ historical value. Few people at the time could have predicted that we’d be still talking about Jane today, or that Cassandra’s actions would form the basis for a BBC drama more than 200 years on.

Title: Historical anniversaries | March
Date: No Publication Date
Content:
What historical anniversaries are in March? We round up the events, births and deaths…
On 1 March, something extraordinary happened on the south coast of France. Napoleon – who had escaped from Elba on the brig Inconstant – landed in the seaside village of Golfe-Juan, between Cannes and Antibes, with a thousand men. He issued a defiant proclamation, asserting his right to rule.
As smoke rose from the Goths’ camps, Belisarius knew that his gamble had paid off. He waited until half the retreating Gothic forces were across the Milvian Bridge, and then ordered his troops out of the city. They killed thousands of Goths, and many more were drowned. Belisarius had won. For the time being at least, Rome remained Roman.
Although the parade got off to a slow start, it was soon evident that this was no passing demonstration. Never before had so many women marched together in pursuit of their right to vote. Marching down Pennsylvania Avenue with two dozen floats, nine bands and four mounted brigades, they were led by the figure of the lawyer and activist Inez Milholland, atop a white horse and wearing a white cape.
There was still a chill in the air on the morning of 4 March 1918. Private Albert Gitchell, a US Army mess cook, woke feeling hot and achy, his throat burning. Physically unable to attend to his duties, he dragged himself to the infirmary – Hospital Building 91 – where his temperature was taken, recording a shocking 39.4°C. Wary of spreading whatever disease had infected Gitchell, the camp doctor recom- mended that the cook – whom he diagnosed with “a bad cold” – spend a few days in a separate tent.
It was already too late. Almost immediately afterwards, several more patients descended on the infirmary complaining of the same symptoms. Before lunchtime, 107 cases of the mysterious flu were recorded at Fort Riley.
Stalin’s daughter Svetlana remembered the final moment. “He literally choked to death as we watched,” she wrote. “The death agony was terrible … At the last minute, he opened his eyes. It was a terrible look, either mad or angry, and full of the fear of death.” For a moment, Stalin raised his hand, as if pointing or threatening. “Then,” Svetlana wrote, “the next moment, his spirit after one last effort tore itself from his body.”
It was at about 5.30 in the morning that the Mexicans launched their final assault on the Alamo. Five months earlier, American settlers in Texas, or ‘Texians’, had rebelled against the Mexican government, driving away their forces. During the inevitable Mexican counterattack, more than 200 Texian rebels had become trapped at the Alamo Mission, near San Antonio. Steadily the besiegers tightened their grip, and now they were ready to finish the job.
“On the venerable day of the Sun,” Constantine ordered, “let the magistrates and people residing in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed. In the country however persons engaged in agriculture may freely and lawfully continue their pursuits because it often happens that another day is not suitable for grain-sowing or vine planting; lest by neglecting the proper moment for such operations the bounty of heaven should be lost.”

Members of the British cabinet were questioning the French spy the Marquis de Guiscard when he pulled out a knife and stabbed Sir Robert Harley in the chest. Harley, who as chancellor of the exchequer was one of Queen Anne's chief ministers, was said to have been saved from death thanks to the heavy gold thread embroidery that his sister Abigail had sewn onto his coat, which broke the blade of the knife. Harley was, however, wounded by a second blow and forced to take to his bed for six weeks.
As Justice Story began speaking, it became clear that the Supreme Court had sided with the slaves. As their lawyer put it, they had been “unlawfully kidnapped, and forcibly and wrongfully carried on board”, so they were entitled to their freedom. Abolitionist supporters paid for them to be put up in Farmington, Connecticut, where they were given English lessons and Bible classes, while fundraisers collected money to send them back home. A year later, they set eyes on the African coast for the first time since they had been kidnapped. Most disappeared into obscurity. But one, Sarah Margru Kinson, later returned to the United States to study at Oberlin College, before going back to Sierra Leone as a Christian missionary.
The Praetorian Guard, sick of Elagabalus’s excesses, switched their allegiance to his cousin Severus Alexander and turned on Elagabalus. As the historian Cassius Dio recorded, there was no mercy for either Elagabalus or his mother: “Their heads were cut off and their bodies, after being stripped naked, were first dragged all over the city, and then the mother’s body was cast aside somewhere or other while his was thrown into the river.”
The move gave more control to ordinary investors and allowed the company to run a lottery to raise funds
Using a telescope of his own design, astronomer William Herschel observed the planet later named Uranus from the back garden of his house in New King Street, Bath. He originally thought it was a comet.
Even the sceptics had to admit that it was a colourful occasion. As if determined to confirm their killjoy reputation, the heads of the women’s colleges had scheduled the race for 1.15pm, “in order to avoid a large body of spectators”. All the same, the banks were packed with “enthusiastic undergraduates, flinging confetti over the river, and blowing toy trumpets”.
Marie Stopes opened Britain 's first family planning clinic, the Mothers' Clinic, in Holloway, north London. In 1925 the clinic moved to Whitfield Street in central London, where it remains to this day.
On 18 March 978, a brutal murder was committed at Corfe in Dorset – and the victim was Edward, king of the English. “No worse deed for the English race was done than this,” the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle lamented.
The main suspect for the assassination was Edward’s stepmother, Ælfthryth, widow of his father, King Edgar. Certainly she had a motive: with Edward dead, his younger half-brother – her son, Æthelred – would inherit the English throne. It has been supposed that she invited the young king to Corfe to participate in a hunt, with murder in mind.
As the secretary of the Football Association admitted, the theft had cast “quite a cloud” over the forthcoming tournament. But then, on 27 March, the cup was found. Out walking with his owner in South Norwood, a dog called Pickles disappeared beneath a hedge, and reappeared with something wrapped in newspaper – the Jules Rimet trophy.
By March 1617, at the end of her London visit, Pocahontas was possibly already gravely unwell, and not keen to travel back to Virginia. As an observer wrote: “She is on her return though sore against her will, if the wind would come about to send them away.”
It was planned that the family would sail from London on the George, belonging to Samuel Argall, deputy governor of Virginia. Before the ship set out on the long ocean voyage, it dropped anchor at Gravesend to gather supplies and fresh water. Here, Pocahontas was taken off the ship, dying or possibly already dead. Her body was laid to rest in the chancel of Saint George’s Church – a superior place of burial usually reserved for clergy or high-standing parishioners.
Gordon Gould, who coined the term laser and whose patent application had been rejected, began a 30-year legal battle for his patent rights
Many accounts agree that the plotters initially planned to force Paul to abdicate, but alcohol soon took over. In the confusion, one officer hit the struggling Paul in the face with a golden snuffbox. The emperor went down, and a group of the plotters piled on top of him, kicking and choking him. One of them wrapped a sash around his neck and began to tighten. Then, when he had stopped twitching, they kicked and stamped on his body, until they were pulled away.
The next morning, when Paul’s son Alexander, now emperor, reviewed the guards, they were wearing their old uniforms.
As night fell on the 24th, the men chosen for the escape attempt assembled in Hut 104.
By the time the Germans realised the prisoners were getting out, 76 men had crawled to freedom. The snow was so deep that they were forced to use main roads rather than forest paths, as they had planned, and all but three were soon recaptured. Hitler wanted them all shot; in the end, 50 were executed.
The Abolition of the Slave Trade Act entered the statute books on 25 March 1807, making it illegal to trade enslaved people within the British colonies. The act – culmination of a decades-long struggle by abolitionists in Britain – ruled that, from 1 May 1807, “dealing and reading in the purchase, sale, barter, or transfer of slaves or of persons intending to be sold, transferred, used, or dealt with as slaves, practiced or carried in, at, or from any part of the coast or countries of Africa shall be abolished, prohibited and declared to be unlawful”.
Today, with an estimated 15 million Mormons worldwide, original copies of theBook of Mormonchange hands for well over $50,000. But when the book first went on sale on 26 March 1830, sales were disappointing. Many local citizens thought it was blasphemous; another Palmyra paper even called it “the greatest piece of superstition that has come to our knowledge”.
Local farmer Martin Harris had mortgaged his property to pay for Smith’s security. Harris lost everything, yet he never lost his faith in the Book of Mormon. It was “no fake,” he said on his deathbed. “I know what I know. I have seen what I have seen and I have heard what I have heard. I have seen the gold plates from which the Book of Mormon is written.”
As Hamilton reached the clerk’s table he gave “an almost imperceptible thumbs up”. On the other side, a Tory whip was whispering to Mrs Thatcher, and her face paled. “I don’t believe it,” she mouthed, and a gasp of triumph came from the Labour benches. Had they pulled it off, against all the odds?
Then the clerk of the house handed the voting slip to the Conservative teller, Spencer Le Marchant, and the mood changed. Suddenly the government benches were deathly silent, and all the noise was coming from the opposition. “Order, order!” said the speaker, and the house fell absolutely still.
“The Ayes to the right, 311,” Le Marchant said. “The Noes to the left, 310.” Even before he had finished, there came from the Tory benches a roar of unbridled joy. They had done it. Now the election was on.
It was on Easter Monday, just before the evening Vespers service at the Church of the Holy Spirit, Palermo, that the moment came. As crowds gathered outside the church for the annual festival, a group of swaggering, tipsy French officials, with a man called Drouet particularly prominent, made overtures to some young Sicilian women. In the ensuing melee, one outraged husband plunged his knife into Drouet – and all hell broke loose.
“To the sound of the bells,” wrote the great historian Steven Runciman, “messengers ran through the city calling on the men of Palermo to rise against the oppressor. At once the streets were filled with angry armed men, crying ‘Death to the French’… They poured into the inns frequented by the French and the houses where they dwelt, sparing neither man, woman nor child.” Whenever they found a suspected Frenchmen, the mob demanded that he pronounce the local word ciciri, which outsiders invariably found difficult. Anyone who failed the test was killed.
By the next morning, 2,000 people lay dead. The War of the Sicilian Vespers had begun; it would last for another 20 years.
The tower was an instant hit: illuminated every night by gas lamps, it dominated not just the Exposition, but Paris itself. When the public were finally allowed in, the lifts were still not working. Yet in the first week alone, almost 30,000 people climbed to the top – a sign of how completely it had caught the world’s imagination.

Title: "Dog poo was valuable": 5 things you (probably) didn't know about dogs

Chris Pearson reveals surprising facts about humanity’s evolving relationship with its canine companions over the centuries
Today, most dogs – certainly in western societies – are pets, providing companionship in return for food, strokes and a comfy bed (or sofa). But pet-keeping is a relatively recent phenomenon. In the Middle Ages, pets were largely the preserve of wealthy women and scholars. Most dogs were expected to work outdoors as guard dogs, herders and hunters.
From the 18th century, though, urbanisation, industrialisation and the rise of middle-class consumer cultures fuelled a boom in pet dogs that led increasingly leisurely lives.
Working dogs became less common, and some types disappeared altogether. Take the turnspit dog, forced to run around in a wheel to turn meat cooked in front of kitchen fires. These small, sturdy dogs with long bodies, short legs and stumpy tails worked for hours on end in sweltering conditions. Possibly the last recorded uses of turnspit dogs was at St Briavel’s Castle, Gloucestershire in 1844. They were replaced by coal-fuelled smoke jacks.
Rabies is a rare but horrific viral disease that attacks the nervous system. It has ancient origins: the Marduk Prophecy, an Assyrian text dating from between 713 and 612 BC, listed rabies as one of the plagues that would afflictBabylonshould the deity Marduk leave the city to its fate: “Dogs will become rabid and bite people. All the persons whom they bite will not survive but will die.”
The symptoms of rabies are terrifying – including, most notoriously, a fear of water – and, once they have developed, death is almost inevitable. Historical treatments for rabies, including the hair of the dog – placing a hair from the rabid animal on a bite wound – were ineffective. Unsurprisingly, then, outbreaks of public hysteria about rabid dogs erupted sporadically, often whipped up by the press, which gleefully reported stories of ‘mad dogs’.
Such anxieties led to changes in how humans and dogs lived together. In the 19th century, countless street dogs were rounded up, killed or muzzled, and dog movements became more tightly controlled. These measures continued even after the introduction of Louis Pasteur’s much-heralded vaccination in 1885, and after it spread across Europe and around the globe. Although indigenous canine rabies was eradicated from Britain in 1902, the legacy of fear of the disease is evident in the absence of street dogs and widespread leashing in the UK.
Today, dog faeces is a disgusting nuisance on many streets, and a frequent cause of complaints – but it wasn’t always so. In the 19th century, some poor Parisians collected and sold this ordure tomégissiers(tannery workers), who turned sheepskins into leather: 10kg of dog faeces could treat 12,000 skins.
Henry Mayhew, the famous social investigator, wrote about “pure finders” in his bookLondon Labour and the London Poor(1851). ‘Pure’ was the term for dog poo used to scour and purify goat and calf skins in the Bermondsey tanyards, removing moisture from the tissue and improving the smell of leather destined for book covers and other uses. Mayhew found that pure finders were better educated than the bone grubbers and other labourers withinLondon’sblood-and-guts economy: many were former tradespeople, mechanics or semi- skilled labourers who had fallen on hard times.
As streets became paved and cleaner, authorities began to introduce anti-fouling rules and measures, which were tightened up further during the 19th century. The former use of dog excrement as a valuable resource was forgotten, and it became merely another smelly problem to solve.
In the UK and other western countries, we understand dogs primarily through the prism of breed, which is often seen as reflecting the personality of an owner. Crufts and other shows reinforce the notion that dogs are supposed to look and behave a certain way. But this system of categorising dogs is relatively new.
Before the 19th century, dogs were defined by what they did rather than how they looked. Then, during the Victorian era, an assortment of aristocratic British breeders and working-class dog fanciers (men who bred animals, often terriers, for fighting and display) founded breed lineages, stud books and dog shows.
The Kennel Club, founded in 1873, was emulated across the world as breeders invented lineages and standards, classifying doggy diversity into defined breeds. Mongrels and dogs of no fixed breed survived, but the system had become firmly established as the dominant way to understand and value dogs.
Today, debate rages about the merits, faults and legacy of the British empire, but it may come as a surprise to learn that dogs were part of this story.
British workers and administrators took dogs with them to the colonies, expressing concerns about how their pets would adapt to the Indian climate or life in the west African bush. They also exported the trappings of Victorian dog culture – in India, their foxhounds chased jackals instead of the russet species hunted in Britain – along with distinctly imperialist attitudes.
There was an imperialist belief that European pedigree dogs were more civilised than African and Asian canines, which they labelled ‘pariah’ after the oppressed Paraiyar caste group of southern India. Meanwhile, kennel clubs and dog shows were established, along with animal protection societies that often castigated local people’s cruelty towards animals.
Imperial authorities also used dogs to police enslaved people in the Caribbean and colonised communities in Palestine, Kenya and Rhodesia, and launched campaigns to cull street dogs. At times, these measures were resisted: in 1832, a large-scale protest was launched to oppose culling in Bombay. At others, local elites colluded, even participating in dog shows.
