India will be looking to maintain their unbeaten streak in the tournament. New Zealand, on the other hand, will look to carry forward their dominant form from the semi-final.
With the final being a day-night match -- the role of dew and the decision at the toss will be critical factors. Teams have historically favoured chasing at this venue due to the impact of dew.

Dew makes makes batting easier in the second innings. Will this trend continue or will the pressure of a final bring a different approach?
The pitch at the Dubai stadium offers early movement for fast bowlers -- especially in the first few overs when the ball is new. Batsmen will need to be cautious early on as seamers can extract swing and bounce under lights.

Batting conditions tend to improve as innings progresses though. Spinners can be tricky in the middle overs -- particularly if the pitch slows down.
India has a strong spin attack -- with the likes of Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Ravindra Jadeja, Varun Chakaravarthy, and Washington Sundar. The team will need to assess how much grip the surface provides before finalizing their bowling line-up.
One of the most defining aspects of day/night games in Dubai is the dew factor. The dew in the second innings makes it difficult for bowlers -- especially spinners to grip the ball.
This gives an advantage to the chasing team. The statistics back this trend -- of the 62 ODIs played at this venue, teams batting second have won 37 times while those setting a target have won just 23 matches.
The 2025 Champions Trophy has followed a similar pattern -- with three of the four games played in Dubai won by the team chasing. Given these numbers, both captains will likely prefer to bowl first if they win the toss.
They will be looking to have an advantage of batting under better conditions later in the match. India’s selection of five spinners could be tested if they find themselves defending a total in dewy conditions.

Newcastle United forward Anthony Gordon faced one of the toughest moments of his career after being sent off against Brighton in the FA Cup.
The red card not only cost his team in that match but also ruled him out of three crucial games, including the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool.
The young winger was devastated, but his reaction inside the dressing room left a strong impression on his teammates and manager Eddie Howe.

Gordon didn’t wait long to address his mistake. As soon as the game ended, he stood up in the dressing room and apologized to his teammates for leaving them a man down.
"He said a couple of words to the players in the dressing room and I think at that stage everyone was highly emotional, anyway," Howe revealed. "He did the right thing and stood up and took accountability."
Newcastle opted against appealing the decision, meaning Gordon will miss thePremier Leaguegames against West Ham and Brentford, along with the massive Carabao Cup final.
It’s a major setback for both the player and the team, especially considering Gordon’s importance in Newcastle’s attack this season.
Despite the disappointment, Gordon has responded in the best possible way — by showing professionalism in training and staying positive.

Being sidelined for key matches could break a player’s confidence, but Gordon has shown resilience. Instead of sulking, he has kept his energy high in training and continues to support his teammates.
"Anthony was hugely disappointed on Sunday, and I think there’s that realization once the game ends — you understand the repercussions," Howe said. "I’m sure Sunday night and Monday were tough for him, but he’s quickly come back to us and trained really well."
Howe also praised Gordon’s attitude in training, stating that he wouldn’t have guessed the player was dealing with such a setback.
"You wouldn’t know there’s a disappointment there — huge respect to him for that. He’s trying to help his teammates because now he knows his job is to train really well, be there as a support, and push us on to achieve something great in his absence."
While Newcastle will feel the absence of Gordon, his response to adversity speaks volumes about his character. The Magpies will hope to make their cup final count, with Gordon cheering them on from the sidelines.

"I believe in myself," she explained. "When you have a good camp and you put the work in, I think that's where the belief and confidence come from.
"Definitely. Everyone keeps saying to me I'm inexperienced and that. I fought one of the most experienced fighters tonight [in Jonas].

"I've got respect for both of them as well. I respect everyone who I get in the ring with. I'm in this game because I want to be in the biggest fights. I want to be active. I'm in my prime, I'm motivated, I'm driven and I want to just keep going."
Beating Jonas at the Royal Albert Hall, headlining a major all women's bill, was a momentous moment for Price.
"To do that tonight and make history with Tash is something that will live with me for the rest of my life," she said.
"To have that, to box here tonight is up there with [winning Olympic gold]. When they shouted Pricey and were singing Tom Jones… Nights like tonight, it's worth it."
She is determined to become an undisputed world champion before the year is out.
"In this game you've got to be able to box and you've got to be able to fight as well. I can do both. Obviously I've only had nine pro fights and you're starting to see it a little bit more now," Price said.
"I feel like I'm improving all the time and I just want to keep learning. I live the life. I don't think you ever become the complete package, the complete fighter, because you never stop learning, but I always want to add to my game.
"I believe I can follow in the footsteps of Katie Taylor. I've got a nation behind me, I'm Olympic champion, I can go all the way."
