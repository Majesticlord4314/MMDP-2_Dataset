Title: Driven: Mercedes-Benz Electric Van Prototype Seeks to Carve a New Niche
Date: 2025-03-05T23:01:00Z
Content:
Merc's upcoming Van.EA platform goes where no M-B van has gone before.
TheMercedes-Benzvan you see here is still nearly a year away from a proper reveal. We don't even know its name yet, which is why the only name you'll see here is Van.EA. While Van.EA sounds like a shady website streaming bootleg NFL games, it's actually a brand-new electric-vehicle architecture that will eventually underpin all corners of Mercedes-Benz's van empire. Mercedes, aware of current consumer hesitancy, has a complementary combustion-engine platform in the works too. But the most interesting part of Van.EA is that this effort is going to result in a high-end people mover aimed at both China and the United States.
If you're familiar with JDM-fanboy favorites like the Toyota Alphard and Lexus LM, that gives you an idea of what Mercedes is cooking up. Something that can serve as high-end VIP transport, chauffeuring—things beyond trips to Target.
It's worth noting that, while this type of vehicle is popular in China, the current U.S. market for luxury minivans is, well, pretty much nonexistent. We have minivans, but not a lot of them, and none that really lean into Benz-level luxury or try to cater to buyers outside the confines of the middle-class nuclear family. The old Metris had a passenger variant, but its commercial roots were obvious; its high-and-forward driving position felt more like that of a Sprinter than a GLS-class.
That's what Van.EA aims to change. Private-use vans, as development head Andreas Zygan put it, will no longer "have to carry the burden" of so many commercial-grade components and hard points; that would immediately put a six-figure minivan into "hard sell" territory with discerning buyers. In fact, to further push it away from its roots, the M-B vans team started collaborating more closely with coworkers from the passenger-cars division.
The hope is that the new high-end people mover built on this Van.EA architecture will become favored transport for shuttling VIPs of all stripes. But Mercedes surely wouldn't be disappointed if you also see many of these suckers stuck in a mile-long pickup line at your local private school.
In terms of straight facts and figures? Not a ton.
Van.EA will run on an 800-volt architecture, which means it should be pretty quick at the DC fast-charger. If you're charging at home, the platform's onboard unit can accept AC juice at up to 22 kW, which is almost enough zap to grant sentience to your circuit-breaker panel. Dual-motor all-wheel drive and rear-axle steering will be available. We don't have any powertrain output figures, nor do we have knowledge of the battery chemistry or motor types, but we do know that Mercedes is aiming for an EPA range estimate north of 300 miles.
If electromobility isn't your hang, worry not. Van.EA will be followed by Van.CA, which will be a variant of the platform dedicated to internal-combustion powertrains. CA shares approximately 70 percent of its components with EA, and they're able to be built on the same production line, so think of it less as a separate platform and more of an internal-combustion analogue. Even kissin' cousins would be too distant.
The two diverging roads in this yellow wood will offer several variants to suit all sorts of needs. The new platform won't be limited to six-figure moonshots; there'll be plenty of commercial models and middle grounds to fill the gaps. But we may have to wait a few more months to get the full skinny there.
To give the new electric van a very, very early shakedown, we headed to Mercedes-Benz's winter testing grounds outside Arjeplog, Sweden. With Van.EA being in the middle of development, its exterior was entirely camouflaged, and the interior was a rat's nest of ethernet cables and shrouds to hide the bits that were further along and closer to production spec.
One thing we can tell you is that three large displays occupy the entire width of the dashboard. There's a gigantic gauge display, and two similarly sized screens next to it—one for traditional infotainment duty, the other for the passenger. It's like a more upright and symmetrical Hyperscreen.
First, we tackled 10 and 15 percent grades, with one side of the vehicle on dry pavement and the other half on ice. A brake-hold feature prevents the van from rolling backward, and all we needed to do was lightly apply the accelerator and let the stability system dole out the torque to the wheels with the most grip. A little bit of wheelspin later, we made it up with barely any lateral deviation.
Then came the low-friction braking. We ran the van up to 62 mph, which admittedly did take awhile on solid ice, but it tracked straight as the stability-control light blinked its little heart out. As we approached a piece of dry pavement, we put half the van on it and slammed the brakes as hard as we could. ABS did its thing, and the ESC once again held the vehicle surprisingly straight. Engineers told us that the goal was to ensure the driver needed no more than a 90-degree steering input to keep the vehicle tracking straight under that kind of braking; we only needed a couple dabs in the 30-degree range.
The last two pieces of the puzzle involved pretty simple stuff. Cones were set up in a square so we could see how tight the turning circle was (the answer: impressively). Then we were set loose on a long stretch of icy pavement, as well as a large skidpad-style plot, to see how well the stability control keeps things in line. While you can definitely turn hard flicks of the steering wheel and unnecessary right-pedal tomfoolery into lurid snowy drifts, the ESC sure as hell doesn't want you to. Half the time, it was already well on its way to sorting us out before we finished our steering corrections.
But, of course, in driving a car for the first time, there's plenty of ancillary stuff to pick up on, too. The seating position was more carlike than in most vans; you sit in it, rather than on it, although the pedals still felt a little too close when your author set the seat for his six-foot frame. Visibility was solid when the camouflage wasn't in the way. The ride over ice and snow was smooth; as we careened over a large dip, the body slowly and surely recombobulated itself without any annoying nautical float.
The biggest issue with Van.EA's major upmarket push won't be the van itself—the foundations seem solid, as one would expect. Instead, the challenge will be convincing well-off Americans that they wantthisinstead of a traditional SUV, especially if that SUV already wears a three-pointed star. To Mercedes, part of what makes something luxurious is a feeling of spaciousness, and a van delivers that in spades. Whether people are willing to accept that shape into their predefined mental image of luxury is a different story.

Title: Tested: 2025 Mercedes-Benz G580 with EQ Technology: Gee Whiz
Date: 2025-02-27T15:28:00Z
Content:
The electric G-wagen unlocks new off-road possibilities as a different kind of four-by-four: four motors, four transmissions.
12/4/24 UPDATE: This review has been updated with instrumented test results.
Okay, let's get this out of the way: "2025 G580 with EQ Technology" is a terrible name. But Mercedes is ditching its EQ branding convention (EQS,EQE, etc) and bringing back the old letter-plus-a-number scheme that everyone understands, so that's the moniker affixed to the new electric G-wagen. Luckily, Benz had the foresight to bestow the electric G with an alphanumeric that lends itself to shorthand—since there is no gas-powered G580, we can simply use that succinct handle for the EV. And from here on out, we will.
The G580 looks very similar to its internal-combustion siblings, theG550 and AMG G63, and that's by design. There are a few subtle nods to aerodynamic efficiency, but not so you'd immediately notice. The G580's most obvious visual tell is its slim exterior cargo bin at the back, which houses a charging cable where you'd expect to find the spare tire. But you can specify a spare tire instead, so even that isn't an automatic giveaway.
The G580 is still a body-on-frameSUV, and indeed the body's mounting points are the same whether a gas or electric G-wagen is coming down the assembly line. The frame itself is much different, though, since it houses a 116.0-kWh battery pack between its rails. Given that the battery precludes the ladder sections of the frame, the pack itself subs in as a stressed member and is designed accordingly, with cells spaced out to allow structural reinforcements tied to the frame. We’ve yet to run the G580 on our 75-mph highway range test, but by the EPA's measuring stick, the G580 will travel 239 miles on a charge.
Also buttressing torsional rigidity: the 127-pound underbody armor plate that protects just about everything between the axles. Mercedes says that this component, which is fastened with 50 bolts, is made of "an intelligent mix of materials including carbon." Which sounds like a step back from claiming a carbon-fiber skid plate, but when you peek beneath the G you'll see a familiar glossy black weave that sure looks like carbon fiber. Whatever Benz calls it, the underbody armor is designed to take severe rock-crawling abuse in the name of battery-pack preservation, because breaching the pack with a boulder would be a major harsh on your trail-ride mellow.
Benz also tested the pack in situations that combined torsional stress with rapid temperature changes because, hey, that's off-roading—you might clamber up a mountain with suspension flexing at max articulation for a mile, getting the motors and battery nice and warm while the trail tries to play Slinky with the structure, and then plunge into a cold creek and suddenly chill all the components. What happens then? Are all the seals still watertight? What if you do all that 10 times in a row? Benz feels confident that its test engineers have abused the G580 more severely and creatively than its customers will.
And in fact, some of its capabilities may be understated. The G580's rated 33.5-inch wading depth is 5.9 inches more than the gas models can manage, but Mercedes concedes that the electric G can go even deeper than that—the powertrain is thoroughly waterproofed. The weak point now: the HVAC air intake. We'd guess that in coming years, Benz will snorkel that intake and enable some really preposterous water fording.
And we can confirm (with an assist from French weather) that the G580 can handle plenty of water. Mercedes arranged a trail drive outside Montpellier, France, that involved billy-goat rock climbs, water fording, and mud. All of those off-road disciplines were more difficult than planned on account of relentless rain. We've been to off-road events where rain completely scrambled the plans, but not here—our hosts just reminded everyone that the climbs would be more treacherous, the water and mud deeper, and we forged on ahead.
We headed out on the trail in pairs, with one driver in a G550 and the other in a G580. Traditionalists, prepare for rending of garments and gnashing of teeth, because the electric G is pretty clearly the superior off-roader.
While the G550 retains its locking front, center, and rear differentials, the 579-hp quad-motor G580 requires no differentials at all, and thus the signature G-wagen diff-lock buttons on the center of the dash are relabeled to reflect the exciting possibilities of independent torque at each corner. The middle button engages low range, which might seem superfluous when you have 859 pound-feet of torque at 0 rpm. But by deploying a 2:1 gear for rock crawling, Mercedes was able to use smaller motors, with the mechanical advantage helping minimize heat buildup during off-road workouts. (The motors use extra lubrication oil to dissipate heat, Porsche 993–style, giving an assist to the coolant circuits. And no, the oil never needs to be changed.) You can switch between low range and high range on the move—while coasting in neutral—which is a neat trick, and the neutral mode allows flat-towing a G580, if you're looking for a luxe runabout to lash behind your Prevost. Besides all that, the low-range capability means that you get to say that your car has four transmissions, which ought to earn bragging rights at your neighborhood off-road park.
Of course, even if there were only a car length of real estate—say, a dead end out on the trail—the G580 could still turn around, thanks to the third button on the dash. That one engages G-turn, which drives the motors on either side of the car in opposite directions to spin it on its axis. After engaging G-turn, you pull the steering-wheel shift paddle for the direction you want to turn and then floor the accelerator and hold the wheel pointing straight. That last part requires some mental recalibration, because it's extremely hard to resist steering a car that's turning, and if you dial in even a bit of lock the system will cancel. And you do have to hold firm to keep the wheel from moving. Follow all the rules and the G580 will spin two full rotations, which is to say one more than is strictly necessary for convenient exit of your Upper East Side parking garage.
The electric G even apes the gas-powered models' live rear axle articulation by using a De Dion rear end, a setup also employed by theeSprinter. The De Dion is sort of a hybrid of a solid rear axle and an independent setup, with the motors centrally mounted and driving the wheels via half-shafts and CV joints while a C-shaped solid axle connects both sides. So unsprung weight is minimized while retaining the articulation prized by off-roaders—one side goes up, the other side goes down. In fact, theG580 handily beat the 2023 G550 Professional's ramp travel index score, recording a limber 549 to the gas G's 511.
Like the other G-classes, the G580 eschews air springs, and its ride height is fixed. It still delivers a properly imperious ride. Time for an apples-to-oranges comparison. The G580's 0.80-g skidpad performance on Falken Azenis FK520 summer rubber demolishes any of the gas-powered G-wagens—the last G63 AMG we tested equipped with the Trail package managed a severely stability-control-limited 0.72 g on its all-terrain tires, and the G550 Professional, just 0.64 g. Despite the G580's 6908-pound curb weight, it's the handling champ of the lineup. Summer tires will do that, and it's the only way to current get a G580. Our fun in in the French mud was on the Professional package's Falken Wildpeak A/Ts, a tire package not yet on the option sheet.
Pin the accelerator long enough, and you might run into the G's electronically limited top speed of 112 mph, at which point the motors are turning 14,500 rpm. The G580 will run in rear-drive mode when possible to aid efficiency, which means that Benz had to consider the possibility that a driver might be cruising at 112 mph on the rear motors, encounter a hill, and suddenly need the dormant front motors to join the party—which means matching motor speed to road speed. So here's a fun stat: The G580's motors can spin up from 0 to 14,500 rpm in 300 milliseconds. The engineers on hand asserted that despite the surge of power required for that trick, selectively disengaging motors is still the most efficient strategy.
With all four motors at work, the G580 hits 60 mph in 4.1 seconds and runs the quarter-mile in 12.6 seconds at 108 mph, numbers that split thedifference between the former twin-turbo V-8 powered 416-hp G550and 577-hp AMG G63. The G550 is now powered by a 443-hp turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six that we have yet to test. The mighty G63 remains the same. When it's time to stop, though, the G580 is best of the bunch, with its 162-foot stop from 70 mph besting the G63 Trail package's performance by 20 feet.
The first G580 with EQ Technology will be the $180,900 Edition One, and if that sounds like too much of a bargain, we'd recommend talking to your sales representative about the Manufaktur customization program, which offers a modest selection of novel exterior colors (20,000). Because there's nothing more embarrassing than seeing your neighbor pull up in a G-wagen painted the same standard-production Obsidian Black Metallic hue that you just ordered.
In the decades since its 1979 introduction, the G-wagen mutated from a hardscrabble four-by-four into a luxury icon, but even its most ridiculous offshoots (looking at you,Maybach G650 Landaulet) were fundamentally capable machines. The electric G not only lives up to those expectations, it expands them. For instance, after experiencing G-steering's radius-carving wizardry, we asked a Mercedes engineer why the gas models couldn't do that too. He conceded that someday they probably will.

Title: The best family hatchbacks - driven, rated and ranked
Date: No Publication Date
Content:
The relentless rise of the SUV and crossover means the conventional compact hatchback isn’t the sales force it once was. Yet while these family-friendly machines aren’t that fashionable these days, they still make more sense than almost any other class of car when it comes to delivering a Swiss Army Knife-like versatility. Practical and spacious enough for most needs, yet still featuring a footprint that’s compact enough not to feel like you’re taking more than your fair share of road space. They also tend to be good to drive, frugal, well-equipped and affordable. What’s not to like?
Moreover, while many have sounded the death knell for the family hatchback, a host of new, all-electric models proves there’s clearly life in the concept yet. As does the fact that there are so many evergreen mainstays of the class that are now in the eighth, ninth or tenth generation and show no sign of slowing down any time soon. In fact, while the high-riding SUVs steal the headlines, the less extroverted compact hatch simply gets on with doing its job so well that it’s difficult to make a case for its wholesale extinction.
In many ways, the onset of electrification has given buyers more choice than ever before. No matter what their needs or tastes, there is something for everyone - whether it's something sensible, sporty, classless or classy. Yet the common thread for all these cars is that they’re relatively modest in size and feature a flexible five-door layout complete with versatile hatchback tailgate.
For the best part of half a century the VW Golf has been in the family car mix, and with the current Mk8 version it claims its place at the top of the hatchback hierarchy. Launched as an ‘all-new’ version in 2020, the German machine is actually an update of the already excellent Mk7, a model that got its own refresh mid-way through its life. Sitting one the now ubiquitous MQB platform, it also uses largely the same petrol and diesel engine line-up, albeit with the addition of 48V mild hybrid tech on some versions
Either way, the sum of all these minor tweaks is a seriously impressive car. As far as ride refinement, handling and performance are all concerned, the Golf’s balanced blend of talents make it the most complete and grown-up offering in the class. That said, a slightly stiffer suspension set-up means we’d ideally steer clear of the cheaper, torsion-beam-equipped models - those versions with a multi-link rear axle feel more pliant and sophisticated.
Interior space has been improved, too, and an even more high-tech infotainment offering will appeal to many, although it isn't the most intuitive touchscreen system to use. What’s more, the cabin doesn't quite retain the levels of material plushness we were used to in previous Golfs, plus some areas of trim lack the indestructible feel we’ve become used too. And the less said about the unilluminated touch sensitive climate control temperature adjusters the better.
The driver’s hatchback continues to live up to its name after one final update
The latest GTI version has proved to be an effective hot hatch, but with a sharper, more focused set-up than ever before, it has lost some of the effortless everyday usability that so successfully marked out its predecessors, and it isn't the most engaging car in its class either. By no means the worst GTI ever, but its priorities seem to be a little out of kilter.
The plug-in hybrid GTE version, though, now feels more like a bona fide plug-in hot hatch than ever before; and the range-topping Golf R has both the pace and technical specification to really get your attention - although it comes at a high price. The Golf continues to have almost all hatchback tastes and requirements well covered.
Ford has revealed that the Focus is living on borrowed time with no direct replacement due when production of the current car stops next year. Even so, while the car's cards are clearly marked, it remains the clear choice of family drivers who like to have fun. With its outstanding handling and pliant, well-resolved ride means it's still one of the best hatchback’s from behind the wheel. In fact, for engagement and agility, this is arguably the best Focus since the outstanding original turned the class on its head in 1998.
There's plenty of space inside, while a completely new platform and exterior have given the Ford a new lease of life. Its cabin still doesn't quite offer the same levels of fit and finish quality or material richness as rivals in this list, though.
This fourth-generation model is available with both petrol and diesel engines, with modern hybridised Ecoboost petrols now being the default choice. Base models make use of a torsion beam rear suspension configuration and passive dampers instead of the multi-link arrangement, partnered optionally with adaptive dampers, of more powerful models. Even the lower-end and less sporty configurations of the car stand clear of their rivals for handling dynamism, though.
The excellent 2.3-litre Focus ST represents the sportiest offering in the line-up. Somewhat unfortunately, Ford has ruled out a full-bore RS for this model generation, but the warbling ST will be more than enough fun for a great many people, especially when fitted with the optional Track Pack, which runs to KW coilover suspension, sticky Pirelli rubber and limited slip front differential.
The latest Octavia remains true to its roots by sticking to its traditional strengths: practicality and affordability. Sure it’s not the most stylish and dynamic, but when it comes to being a family car it’s extra space and usability means for most of the time you're unlikely to mind.
In estate guise, the Octavia simply outclasses all of its rivals for boot space, while the hatchback version isn't exactly short on space, either. To drive, it might not offer the sort of engagement you get from a Leon or the same levels of sophisticated ride refinement as the Golf, but it certainly isn't far off. Moreover, in terms of interior quality and class it arguably outsrips its close cousins, feeling more like the product of upmarket VW arm, Audi.
As ever, it remains the pragmatist's choice among its VW Group siblings. Those simply looking for an affordable family runabout with acres of passenger and storage space will be seriously impressed by what's on offer here. At the same time, anyone stepping out of a Focus might be a bit put off by its comparatively sedate character. The new Octavia vRS models - which are available in petrol and diesel and with either two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive - all go a long way to rectifying such complaints, though.
It's been a case of evolution not revolution with the latest Peugeot 308, which despite its 'all-new' claims actually uses much of its predecessor's underpinnings. That said, it's a little longer and wider than before, while the smartly styled exterior is handsome, well-proportioned and kitted out with distinctive daytime running lights.
It's perhaps not as roomy as the class leaders, with those in the rear getting a little less leg and headroom than they would in a VW Golf, let alone a Skoda Octavia. But the interior looks the part, with slick design and a material quality that finally does justice to Peugeot's posturing that it's now a premium player. As ever, the small-wheel and high-set instrument cluster of the i-Cockpit layout will please as many as it frustrates.
Under the bonnet there's a range of turbocharged petrol and diesel engines, plus a pair of plug-in hybrids that offer either 178bhp or 222bhp. Both, however, will crack a claimed 40 miles in EV mode, qualifying them for a more attractive 8% BiK rate. Regardless of motive power, the 308 handles with a fluidity that nimbleness that used to be a French car calling card, while a composed ride and decent refinement that make it an easy-going companion when you just want to get to your destination. This is particularly true of the entry-level turbocharged 1.2-litre model, which has a compelling less-is-more character that makes it the pick of the bunch.
With an even lengthier back catalogue than VW Golf, the latest Honda Civic is now in its eleventh generation having made its debut in 1972. Yet while its German rival has always been a member of the family hatchback class, the original Civic started out supermini-sized, only properly graduating to the next sector up around twenty years ago. Either way, all we need to know is that the current car is the best yet.
Like many of the best Honda’s, there’s some clever engineering at the heart of its appeal. Perhaps unsurprisingly it’s a petrol-electric hybrid, but unlike most it’s effectively of the range-extending type with its four-cylinder ICE being used as a generator most of the time and the electric motor providing the motive force. It works exceptionally well, proving smooth, responsive and, for the most part, frugal.
Better still is the chassis, which serves-up enough dynamism through its accurate steering and biddable handling to keep most keen driver’s happy, yet also rides comfortable and quietly. The sense of serenity is enhanced by an interior that’s spacious, robustly built and easy to operate. The boot’s a decent size too, while its retractable parcel shelf is work of simple genius.
For the ultimate thrill-seeker there’s the Type-R fast flagship that effectively packages the old car’s mechanicals (306bhp 2.0-litre four pot) into the new body. It’s a riot to drive and has just reclaimed the Nurburgring lap record for front-drivers, but supply is limited and the price has jumped to an eye-watering £47,000.
Until recently it felt as if MG was simply treading water with its line-up of SUVs, small hatchbacks and single estate car offering. Delivering great value and loads of kit, these Chinese machines had plenty of showroom appeal, but their budget roots were often cruelly exposed on the road. However, with the new, all-electric MG 4 the brand has served-up a family hatch that deserves serious attention.
With its rakish looks it stands out from the crowd, while some effort has clearly been expended on the dynamics, creating a family hatch that is surprisingly engaging to drive. With a rear-mounted motor the MG4 has a surprisingly biddable rear-wheel drive feel, while the steering is uncorrupted by torque steer unruliness - although it could do with more feel. Yet the highlight is the relatively soft suspension that allows the car to slice down typically pockmarked British roads with poise and fluidity.
There’s a choice of 168bhp or 201bhp motors, with both giving brisk acceleration, while the larger 64kWh battery promises up to 281 miles on a charge. DC rapid charging capability of 150kW means 10-80% charge can be achieved in as little as 35 minutes. Oh, and another eye-catching number is the price, which starts at £26,995 - if you want something similar from a mainstream brand you’ll be paying around £10,000 more.
So, what’s the catch? Well, that price gives you a clue. While the interior is roomy and well-equipped, the fit and finish are a bit bargain basement. The electronic driver aids also feel a step behind in their clumsy operation. Still, there’s fine family car lurking here, and you’ll happily overlook some of the issues when you consider the savings.
The VW’s ID3 used to be one of our favourite all-electric hatchbacks, but in this top 10 it's the German machine’s Spanish-flavoured close cousin that gets the nod. Ostensibly these two machines are near identical, but thanks to its subtly retuned suspension the Cupra Born’s extra driver delight makes the difference.
Based on the VW Group’s MEB platform, the Born features the now familiar ‘skateboard’ layout of battery between the axles for a flat floor and a rear mounted motor that gives some packaging advantages. Externally, a new nose and some natty colours identify it as a Cupra, but the car’s ID3 roots are clear to see. It’s even more obvious on the inside, where the acceptably roomy interior is largely carried over, complete with the surprising use of some low rent plastics.
There’s a choice of 201 and 237bhp motors, plus the option of 58 and 77kWh battery packs, the latter giving a range of up to 331 miles. All versions accelerate with warm hatch vigour, while the nicely calibrated chassis serves-up agility and poise when pressing on, although a slightly firm ride is the trade-off for this control. A little extra humour from the electronic safety net would likely unlock a little extra rear-drive flamboyance, but overall the Cupra is a born entertainer.
Toyota has sold a staggering 50 million Corollas since the 1960s. This is one of the very best-selling cars that the planet has ever known. While it's been a permanent fixture of Toyota's model range in other markets, it replaced Europe's unlovely Auris hatchback with the introduction of the current twelfth-generation version in 2018, and caused a stir in the process by showing that Toyota could produce a family hatchback with strong interior quality and practicality, and really creditable driving dynamics too.
The Corolla was introduced with the choice of a conventional 1.2-litre turbocharged petrol engine, or one of two petrol-electric 'self-charging' hybrids - although the car's entry-level petrol option has since been discontinued. That means this car is a little pricier to buy than some of its rivals, and it also means that there's no way to avoid Toyota's modern hybrid-car driving experience with it; not that you need be worried about it.
The regular 1.8-litre option is still a little slow in outright terms, but it's certainly efficient, and more responsive and refined than it used to be. But the upper-level 2.0-litre hybrid powertrain gives the Corolla plenty of performance and good accessible torque, and also puts near-50mpg efficiency within easy reach.
This car now has a chassis good enough to demand the respect of any European car-maker, and at least one powertrain strong enough to give it some useful exercise. There's even a hot four-wheel drive GR versions, but we're cruelly denied it here in Europe.
Cracking into this list at all, in a very crowded hatchback market, is something of a result for BMW, whose 1 Series hatchback – famously the only car in the class to attempt to wield a rear-wheel-drive chassis in the modern era - has what we might call a dynamically troubled past.
Suffice to say that now it has adopted mechanical convention for engine layout and axle drive, the latest 1 Series has lost little and gained quite a lot. A front-wheel-drive layout (four-wheel-drive options are offered in tandem with the more powerful engines) serves the car well and handling is neat and secure, with body control and driver engagement good enough to distinguish the car against most of its rivals. Interior packaging, meanwhile, is much better than in the rear-driven predecessor, with second-row occupant space and luggage capacity both markedly improved, but still only broadly class-competitive.
A good choice of impressive petrol and diesel engines, mated for the most part to slick and efficient transmissions, and equally impressive on-board infotainment technology all make the 1 Series an easily recommended option in the hotly contested premium family hatch market. The new 128ti variant is shaping up to be a strong challenger to the Mk8 Golf GTI, while the recently tweaked all-wheel-drive M135i finally lives up to the promise of its desirable specification while delivering serious all-weather pace.
For a while the Mercedes A-Class was a firm fixture of the UK’s new car sales top 10, it’s mix sleek style, classy cabin, bleeding edge infotainment and some juicy PCP deals making it one of the country’s favourite family hatches. The German has slipped off the hit parade over the past 12 months, but a recent refresh aims to re-inject some of its showroom appeal.
Visually, the Mercedes looks as smart as ever, while inside there’s the same mix of quality and tech that gives it the feel of something even more expensive. There’s no increase in space, but removing the rotary controller for the infotainment has freed-up some extra storage between the front seats, while the infotainment is even slicker and the ‘Hey Mercedes’ voice command function works a treat.
The biggest change has been reserved for the turbocharged 1.3-litre four pot petrol, which now gets de rigeur 48V mild hybrid assistance. It’s available in two states of tune, 134bhp (A180) and 161bhp (A200) guises, the latter feeling far more fleet-footed There’s also a 2.0-litre diesel option, but the plug-in A250e is now only available in the four-door saloon variant.
As before, the Mercedes steers precisely and remains planted on the road, allowing you to scythe through corners with real satisfaction. Refinement is good too, although there’s some road roar and the stiff legged low speed ride can become distracting. It remains a pleasingly upmarket proposition, but with prices starting at a whisker under £32,000 you’ll pay for the privilege.

Title: Buy low, cell high: what to look out for when buying a used EV
Date: No Publication Date
Content:
It’s been a rollercoaster for theused electric carmarket over the past few years.
In the aftermath of the Covid pandemic and the following chip crisis restricting the supply of new cars, some used EVs were commanding more than their original list prices.
But with a much broader array ofEVsgoing on sale, decent availability and widespread uncertainty about EVs, prices slid dramatically. Indeed, data from market analyst Cap HPI shows that by September 2024, a three-year-old EV was some 8.5%cheaperto buy than a petrol car of equivalent age and mileage.
However, that trend is now changing again. In the latter half of 2024, usedEV values stabilisedand actually rose very slightly against falling used ICE car values.
And the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders recorded more than 53,400 used electric car sales in the third quarter of 2024, a rise of 57% on the same period in 2023, so the lower prices are certainly driving demand.
This of course is either terrible or brilliant news, depending on whether you’re selling or buying. But regardless of this mercurial market, there has never been such a great variety of used EVs at such low prices, so now is a superb time to buy before those prices rise any further.
The golden rules for buying a used EV are much the same as for a used ICE car: checking for even gaps and matching paint across all the panels for signs of accident damage, reading its previous MOT test reports and running thorough checks on its history for finance, theft or other misdemeanours. All of that still stands.
Right, now for the big thing: the battery. This is what worries most buyers. We all know thatbatteries degradeover time and usage, yet very few EVs offer a battery health readout on the dashboard.
We would be the first to point out to legislators that a clear battery health readout would be very simple for manufacturers to provide and should be mandated in order to improve buyer confidence.
There’s no reason why checking battery life on your EV shouldn’t be just as simple as checking the battery life on your phone. But, frustratingly, it’s not. And it’s understandable why that makes people edgy about buying a used EV.
The thing to remember is that EV battery longevity is very good these days, and as a rough guide you should expect one (regardless of whether it uses nickel-manganese-cobalt or lithium-iron-phosphate chemistry) to lose roughly 1.6% to 2.0% of capacity each year.
You can buy OBD-port readers that you can plug into an EV in order to get a read on its battery health, but even that can be a bit inaccurate, as it’s affected by the battery’s temperature at the time you take the reading, whether it has been fully cycled prior to testing and the OBD device’s own vagaries.
It’s still absolutely worth doing if you’re confident enough to take a device along when viewing a car you’re considering, but even better advice is to buy from a reputable dealer who is happy to provide a detailed report on the car’s battery health.
As a rough guide for battery health andrange potential, you can of course go by the range readout on the car’s dash. Bear in mind that it will be affected by how the car has been driven previously, and some models are rather optimistic when fully charged (early Stellantis EVs are particularly guilty of this).
Going by the car’s long-term efficiency and calculating range from that tends to give a more realistic average real-world range. Owners’ clubs are also a great place to ask for feedback on a used EV’s realistic range.
If battery health is a concern, then a lower-mileage EV that hasn’t been rapid-charged too frequently is likely to be the best choice, but don’t discount high-mileage cars, because you may be pleasantly surprised by the battery health and real-world range even on a well-used EV.
Indeed, I drove a nine-year-old,260,000-mile Tesla Model Sthat still had 84% of its original battery capacity remaining despite a life spent at Superchargers (Autocar, 6 November 2024).
So don’t feel that you have to stick with low-mileage or younger EVs; just look for one that has a realistic range that suits your lifestyle.
Martin Miller of EV Experts, a specialist dealership in Surrey, points out that heating systems are another area worth checking on a used EV: “The air-con and heating systems are 400V, so to put a new air-con pump in an EV can cost £1000. We recently paid £2200 for a heating element on a Jaguar I-Pace.
It’s one area that can be very expensive.”Suspension wear is something else to look out for, especially on higher-mileage cars: “An EV is still a car, that means that miles do matter. Although not in the same way as an ICE car, where the engine and gearbox are subject to wear each mile, you still need to look for wear in the suspension and braking systems.”
Listen out for clunks and creaks from suspension – especially as EVs are heavier than equivalent ICE cars so can wear suspension parts a touch faster.
Brake pads often last far longer on EVs than on ICE cars, given the presence of regenerative braking systems, but pads should be a routine check on any used car purchase regardless of age, mileage and power source. Ditto the tyres, of course.
In short, the options out there for those buying a used EV are better than ever. Just try to buy from a reputable dealer who knows what they’re talking about and can provide a thorough battery health report.
Make sure to look for a car that offers at least 10-15% more real-world range than you routinely need and a used EV needn’t be a scary prospect.

I've never driven an EV let alone bought one, but would an insistence on a half hour test drive across 10-20 miles of mixed roads not give you a realistic idea of the battery's current range?
Having purchased our first EV some 2 months ago all I would say to any potential buyers is don't rule out basic charging from your regular electrical outlet in your garage. My wife gets home each day around 5:30pm, we plug the EV in, it charges at approx 4 miles per hour, so come 6am its capable of having charged just over 48 miles. Her commute to work and back each day is a total of 11 miles. Think really carefully about what you actually use your car for, not what you 'might' one day do. The car has 330 range fully charged, and if you use full regen braking then urban driving becomes very range favorable.
Your BEV charges at 4 miles per hour, only 48 miles after over 12 hours of charging, are you sure?  Sounds like you charging with a USB charger lol!
Surely you'd want to a dedicated fast charger so as to use your 'high range' BEV as much as possible rather than mainly 6 mile commutes.
Meant 11 mile commute, actually are you from the USA?

Certainly not. He is a communist commuter from comoros
Some nice banter on here as usual, thought I'd wrongly gone to the "Comedy Channel'. Anways, in no particular order, ex-pat living in the USA, vehicle is a Honda Prologue, the point I was highlighting is that auto journalists go on about range anxiety, superchargers etc when 'reviewing' the car, but if your a punter considering am EV just think about what tou actually use your car for.
In our case we knew that the wife only does more than say 50 miles a day maybe once a month, so we can overnight charge the EV in our garage every day by just plugging it into the existing electrical outlet with the charging cable supplied with the vehicle and it charges up at 4 mils charge per hour. No extra charging network expense, no looking for a charger, no sitting around with Tesla drivers, no range anxiety, its just like using your cordless toothbrush, plug it back in when you finish using it, unplug it next time you want to use it. EV ownership really can be that simple if the EV suits your actual daily usage.
Wasn't rude or anything just couldn't work out why you were only putting 4 miles an hour in your car.  Turns out you're on a much lower voltage than over here which might have been worth pointing out at the time.
I hope your wife doesn't drive at 4 miles per hour. What is the cost of a decent wall charger? Then you can charge at least 40 miles per hour.
Fitted in the garage about 500 (parts and labour) but unecessary for us as the 4 miles of charge per hour we currently enjoy from the existing wall socket  (performed overnight when we are sleeping) exceeds the daily draw on the battery from the vehicles use. If the vehicle was say doing 100 miles per day then I would agree a decent wall charger would be the way to go (Honda currently offers a 300 credit towards a wall charger, or 300 of charging credits, we chose the latter).
